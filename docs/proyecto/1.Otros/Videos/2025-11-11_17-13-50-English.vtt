arthritis.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.780
Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.230
Inflammation is the swelling of organs that 
occurs when they become injured or infected

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.550
and can damage your liver.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.480

the brain known as dopamine.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.090
This occurs when digestive enzymes begin to 
digest the pancreas.
