Hello everyone! 

In this video we will explain some of the most common human diseases. These are the diseases we are going to treat 

And first we will start with arthritis. Arthritis is the inflammation or degeneration of one or more joints. A joint is the area where two bones meet. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis. 

The next disease is hepatitis. Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Inflammation is the swelling of organs that occurs when they become injured or infected and can damage your liver. Swelling and damage can affect the proper functioning of this organ. 

The next disease is Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a type of movement disorder. It occurs when nerve cells in neurons do not produce enough of an important chemical in the brain known as dopamine. 

And finally, pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas. This occurs when digestive enzymes begin to digest the pancreas. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either way, it is serious and can lead to complications.
